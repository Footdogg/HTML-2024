    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>Descending from the wolf, dogs are often known as "man's best friend". 
        These lovable animals are loyal to the end, just as they've been
        since the first ever domesticated dog. The domestic dog we know today
        has evolved over time ever since humans took in wolves to raise
        as companions. Dogs love to play games and spend time with their owners, 
        and this is seen in their loyalty to those who take care of them. 
        With enough love and care, a canine companion can turn into a lifelong friend.

    <h2>Cats</h2>
    <p>Evolving from the older wildcats, cats are lovable pets that have
        a knack for sleeping and getting affection. While not as big as 
        most dogs, recent studies have shown that cats can bring just as much happiness 
        to their owners if given proper care and affection. Just like dogs, cats have also been
        prominent in human history, even playing the role of divine figures in
        some older civilizations. In our modern day, these felines have developed
        as sense of love for their humans, even if they still act like our bosses.

    <h2>How our pets help us</h2>
    <p>It's no secret that pets can make us happy, but did you know that cats and dogs can help
        us out in multiple different ways? For example, multiple studies show that owning and playing
        with your pets can ease away stress through the chemical "oxytocin". This chemical is often known
        as the love chemical, and it can create a parent-child relationship between owner and pet. This isn't
        the only benefit pets have in our lives. In fact, pets can support people in their lives, and even save them!
