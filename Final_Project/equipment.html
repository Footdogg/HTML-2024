                        To face the many dangers in Terraria, players need to gear up with the best gear they can get their hands on. Terraria has hundreds of different armor sets and weapons
                        for players to use. Each weapons can be broken down into one of four different damage types: melee, magic, ranged, and summon. Melee weapons allow the user to get in close and
                        strike down their foes with swords, spears, maces, and other similar weapons. Ranged weapons allow for players to stay further back and take down their foes with the use of guns and bows, but a constant
                        supply of ammo will be needed to keep firing. Magic weapons allow for players to blow away their foes with powerful magic attacks as long as they have the mana to keep firing.
                        Summon weapons allow the player give the player control over their own small army of various little creates that'll attack their foes.

            <h3>Armor</h3>

                        Weapons alone won't prosper over the various foes found in the game. A player will also need to equip armor to help fend off their foes. Armor in Terraria caters towards one of four distinct "classes" based off of the damage types. 
                        Each armor set does two different things to help the player. The first thing armor does for a player in defense. Wearing armor increases a player's defense stat which decreases the amount of damage a player takes from an attack. The second thing armor can do for a player is
                        providing different buffs to a player's stats and damage. Different armor sets give different buffs, and certain armor sets are made with a specific type of damage in mind. These buffs can be small increases to damange, an increase to the
                        maximum amount of summons a player can have, or the ability to form sheilds out of pure solar energy. A player's choice of armor will help them survive the harsh world of Terraria, and become a master of their prefered damage type.

            <h3>Accessories</h3>

                        While armor and weapons may be enough for some players, accessories cen provide even further benefits to a player. A player can equip up to 7 accessories at once depending on the difficulty of the world they are playing in.
                        Accessories can be used for offense, defense, mobility, or utility reasons. Offensive accessories usually give the player an increased chance to preform a critical strike, faster attack speed, and an increase of a certain damage type.
                        Defensive accesories can make the player immune to certain debuffs, further increase the defense stat of the player, and even allow players the ability to drop stars on their foes when hit. Mobility accesories allow the player to run faster, run across
                        water in the world, and even take to the skies. Utility accessories can be used for buffs such as increased stats at night, or for an easier time building things in their world. Like armor, choosing the right accessories can make a huge difference for the player.

                        Armor and accessories aren't the only way to give yourself buffs in Terraria, and that's where consumables come into play. There are over 100 different potions and foods in the game to give players helpful buffs. Most foods will give the player one of four stat buffs depending on the food consumed, and these range
                        from a small buff in stats to a massive buff in stats. Potions are where players will get more unique buffs. Most potions will require the player to go out into the world and harvest different ingredients to brew, but some potions
                        can be bought off of a friendly merchant in your towns. Certain potions can even be found in chests or vases located throughout the world. An example of one such potion is the obsidion-skin potion, which gives a buff for temporary immunity to hot surfaces and lava.
                        Eating well and brewing potions can be just as important to survival in Terraria, so don't forget to gather new ingredients whilst you explore.
