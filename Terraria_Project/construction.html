            <h3>Houses</h3>

                            Regardless of what you want to build, every player needs a house. Houses are a necessity in Terraria, as they allow players to set their spawn and move NPCs into their towns. Houses are only considered valid if they meet the in-game
                            requirments for being a valid house. While individual houses have a size limit, multiple houses can be placed together like different rooms to make one giant house. Players can only use beds that are inside of valid housing, meaning you'll
                            need a suitable house to sleep through the night. Once a player has created a valid house, town NPCs will begin to move in. Without housing, a player's world will be much emptier, and harder to traverse.<br><br>Below are some basic requirments for housing:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Houses must be at least 60 tiles large, but cannot be larger than 750 tiles</li>
                            <li>Houses must be at least 10 tiles away from the edge of the world</li>
                            <li>Houses must have no holes greater than 5 tiles in size</li>
                            <li>Houses must have valid background walls</li>
                            <li>Houses must have at least one table and one chair</li>
                            <li>Houses must have a door or platforms</li>
                            <li>Houses must be have a light source</li>
                            <li>Houses cannot exist in an evil biome or the Dungeon biome</li>
                        </ul>

                            Towns are what happen when a player has 3 or more NPCs living in suitable houses within close proximety. Towns are safer areas of the world, only allowing for critters to spawn under normal circumstances.
                            Bosses and event enemies are an exception to the saftey of a town, as they can still spawn naturally in a town given the proper conditions. Pylons can be placed in towns to teleport
                            the player across the world to a different pylon. Towns can be used a different bases of operation around a player's world, allowing them to quickly warp to nearby places of interest.

                            Don't worry about your world feeling lonely, that's where town NPCs come in. Town NPCs are friendly NPCs that provide the player with a variety of goods and services. Most town NPCs, like the Merchant and Arms Dealer, 
                            are able to buy and sell things to the player, allowing for players to get unique items and make a quick buck. Other NPCs, like the Nurse and Goblin Tinkerer, have unique services that thay can provide for the player.
                            Every Town NPC has different living conditions in the form of biomes and neighbors that make them happy, and happy NPCs will give you a discount. Town NPCs will comment on their happiness if asked, so be sure to check in with them to see if they are happy.
                            If NPCs are happy enough, they will sell the player a unique biome pylon that allows for teleportation to other pylons in the world. NPCs can also be submerged into shimmer to give them an entierly new look.
