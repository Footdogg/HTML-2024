            <h2>Version History</h2>
            <p>
                After its initial release in 2011, Terraria has had 4 massive updates, and multiple smaller updates between the major ones, that would go on to forever change the game and how it's played.
            </p>
            <h3>Version 1.1</h3>
            <p>
                This was the first massive update that Terraria recieved after its initial launch. This was the update that introduced the players to hardmode, the
                state the world goes into after a player kills the Wall of Flesh in their world. Hardmode would increase the difficulty in the world, add new enemies, and
                allow for players to progress even further in the game as major updates continued. This update also allowed players to take to the skies with wings. These
                accesories allowed players to move about the world in new ways, and negate high falls from ever harming the character again. This was also the update that introduced
                item modifiers to the game. This gave players the ability to reforge weapons and accesories with a variety of harmful and beneficial status effects. 
            </p>
            <h3>Version 1.2</h3>
            <p>
                The version 1.2 update built off of 1.1's hardmode, adding even harder bosses with the promise of better weapons and armor. The depths of the Jungle became restless
                in this update as it was now hosting 3 new bosses, and the new Jungle Temple biome. This update saw the creation of two new overworld biomes, the Crimson and Snow biomes. The Crimson biome
                hosted its own boss, as well as plenty of repuslve creatures to stave off any unprepared players. The Snow biome would remain without a boss for many years, but offered players
                a chance to relax from the new evils in te world. The final addition was new events ranging from a rainstorms filled with walking fish, to pirate invations that test the player's resolve,
                and even to solar eclipses that would force players to endure the horrors of the night for even longer.
            </p>
            <h3>Version 1.3</h3>
            <p>
                The version 1.3 update introduced what is now the endgame for Terraria, as well as achievemnts, new events, and a new difficulty to really test the players.
                Dangers from beyond the stars began to invade the world, whether it be angry martians or strange lunar events. The Lunatic Cultist and the Mood Lord were added as the final bosses.
                Defeating the Lunatic Cultist would start a strange lunar event, one that would bring the Moon Lord's impending doom to the world. This update also brought some new biomes to the underground portions of the world.
                The Granite and Marble biomes added new stones to the caves, while the Underground Desert biome saw molten caverns filled with lurking dangers hidden in the sands. One of the biggest additions this update added
                was expert mode, a harder difficulty made for players who sought fortune and glory.
            </p>
            <h3>Version 1.4</h3>
            <p>
                Version 1.4 is the most recent major update to Terraria. This patch brought new bosses to the Hallow, a bestiary for the players, golf, new mini-biomes, and master mode.
                Queen Slime and the Empress of Light were added to the Hallow as new bosses. These tough foes rewarded players with a gear based off of the purity of the Hallow. The new bestiary was added
                so players could keep track of the hundreds of different enemies in the game. The sport of golf was added for players to finally enjoy some recreation after saving the world. The Oasis and Graveyard
                added more life, or less depending on the context, to the world of Terraria. The final addition this update was master mode, an even harder challenge for players who took on expert mode like it was nothing.
