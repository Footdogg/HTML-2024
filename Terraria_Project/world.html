                            The world in Terraria is filled to the brim with different enviornments, ranging from lush jungles to vile corruptions. The different enviornments in the game are known as biomes, and there are plenty for players to explore.
                            Each biome has its own set of enemies, bosses, treasures, and locations to explore. Some biomes even have their own mini biomes inside, like the Desert biome's Oasis mini biome. Certain biomes, such as the world's evil biome and the Hallow, can even interact with other
                            biomes around them and change the world. On top of biomes, the world is also divided into 5 different vertical layers, ranging from space to the underworld. Like biomes, layers also affect what treasures, enemies, and structures can spawn. Biomes and layers also affect how happy different
                            npcs are in their housing, either benefiting or hurting the player based on their location in the world.

                            Amongst the different biomes in Terraria, ancient forces of good and evil lurk within the world. The Hallow, Crimson, and Corruption are biomes that will spread across the world as far as they can unless they are stopped by the player, or an incompatable biome.
                            The Hallow is a biome straight out of a fairytale, hosting a plethora of mythical creatures such as pixies and unicorns. The Corruption and Crimson are the evils of the world, and only one of them will naturally spawn in a given world. These three biomes are able to spread
                            through most dirt, snow, sand, and stone blocks. If one of these biomes spreads into another, it will alter the area with new enemies until purified by a clentaminator. The Dryad npc will tell you the percent of each biome in the world, and the Steampunk npc will sell you the
                            clentaminator to change the world as you see fit. While players can mess with these biomes as they see fit, it's best to aim for balance across the world.

            <h3>"Locked" Biomes</h3>
                <div class="dualdisplay">

                            Some biomes of the world are unable to be accessed by players under normal conditions. The Dungeon and the Jungle Temple biomes are the two biggest examples of biomes that are locked at the start of a new world. While it's possible to enter these biomes before they are normally unlocked, players will find that
                            the dangers of the two biomes are too much to handle. The Dungeon will send an enemy who can instantly kill players if entered too early, and the Jungle Temple's traps can easily end any unprepared player. To enter these biomes normally, players will need to defeat the corresponding boss that spawn under certain conditions.
                            After the defeat of the corresponding boss, the biomes will open up to the player to freely explore. While these biomes are notably dangerous to explore, they also possess some of the more valuable treasures of Terraria.

                            Every so often, a world in Terraria may undergo one of multiple events in the game. Some of these events occur naturally once certain conditions are met. Events like the Rain, Blood Moon, and Solar Eclipse are examples of these natural events.
                            Rain may occur at any point in the game, the Blood Moon has a chance to rise every night, and a Solar Eclipse can occur once hardmode begins. During these events, the creatures of the world may begin to behave in strange ways. Each event also brings different enemies
                            to fight with them, randing from flying fish in the rain to giant moths under an ecplised sun.  These events can also occur right after another one ends, meaning a Blood Moon can give way to a Solar Eclipse. Since these events can occur at any given time, players will need to always be ready for them to occur.

                            Foul weather isn't the only kind of event in the game. Invasions from different armies are also able to occur under certai conditions. As a player's world progresses, more armies will being to launch invasions at the player's world. The three main invasions that occur are the Goblin Army,
                            the Pirate Invasion, and Martian Madness. These invasions bring new enemies and mini-bosses with them, making them quite the force to be reckoned with. Invasions only end wen enough of the invaders have been defeated, so it's crucial that players either avoid the surface or be prepared to fight.
                            Goblins and pirates can occur naturally at the start of every day, but Martian Madness can only be started by letting a probe scan you in the Space layer of the world. Upon the completion of these events, new npcs will move into your towns, and certain npcs may begin to sell new items.
