                        There are hundreds of enemies in Terraria that are out to slay players. Among these enemies are slimes, zombies, floating eyes, demons, magic weapons, and giant plants.
                        Every enemy has certain biomes they can spawn in, and some enemies only spawn after a certai condition is met in the world. upon defeat, enemies will drop money and items for the player
                        to pick up. The items and amount of money dropped very from enemy to enemy. Every enemies stats scale with the difficulty of the world, meaning that they'll grown stronger if your world is in expert or master mode.
                        Learning how different enemies behave, as well as how to fight them off is very necessary for survival in Terraria. If a player takes down enough of a certain enemy, they'll be given a banner that provides a damage bonus
                        against that enemy.

                        Beyond the hordes of enemies in the world, bosses await to fight a worthy challenger. Bosses are tougher opponets in Terraria, and bringing them down grants the player powerful rewards. Bosses can be spawned in by meeting certain conditions,
                        killing certain critters, or using their respective spawner. Every boss has a plethora of unique attacks to bring down any player in their way. These attacks are often much deadlier than those of normal enemies, with some attacks being able to
                        instantly kill a player should they land. Running from some bosses may be hazardous for the player, as certian bosses will enrage if they are led away from their home biome. Some bosses in the game, like the Empress of Light and Moon Lord, have multiple phases they progress through as they are fought. 
                        Upon defeat, bosses like Plantera and the Wall of Flesh can permanently change the world with new ores, dangers, and biomes.

                        Living amongst the evils of the world are the harmless critters. These little animals are passive and pose no threat to the player under normal circumstances. Animals such as rabbits, penguins, fish, butterflies, and worms make up Terraria's critters.
                        Most critters can be caught using a bug net, allowing them to be stored in a terrarium or used as fishing bait. Certain critters even have rare gold and gem versions of themselves that will spawn throughout the world's caverns. in addition to the normal animals, faries also exist as critters
                        within Terraria. These helpful creatures will guide the player to nearby treasures! It should be worth noting that two critters, the Prismatic Lacewing and the Truffle Worm, can
                        be used to spawn in certain bosses, so be careful if you find thes rare critters.
