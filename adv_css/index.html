            <h3>About Monster Hunter</h3>
            <p>Monster Hunter is an action rpg series that was debuted in 2004, with the release of the original Monster Hunter.
                Since then, the series has had multiple generations of mainline games and expansions. The mainline games include:

                Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The series features over 200 different monsters to battle across the franchise,
                and over a dozen unique weapons to hunt with. Each weapon has a unique playstyle, so every hunter will be able to find one that suits

            <h3>The Rise of Monster Hunter</h3>
            <p>The original Monster Hunter was released back in 2004 for the Playstation 2, but the series didn't see much of a playerbase in the west.
                This prompted Capcom to release Monster Hunter Dos exclusivly in Japan, and internationl players would never see the original version of the game.
                It wasn't until Monster Hunter Tri Ultimate that the series would gain a lot of popularity in the west. Following this success, Capcom improved and expanded
                in subsequent games up to the release of Monster Hunter World. World saw the highest sales in the series, and this was due to Capcom realizing how many players
                were on the Xbox One and PS4. This success would eventually find its way into Monster Hunter Rise, which finally got a port to Xbox and Playstation after a whole
                year of being locked to the Nintendo Switch. With the recent anniversary, Capcom has releaved that a new game is in the works.
