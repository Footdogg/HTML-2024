            <h3>Monsters</h3>
            <p>As the name of the series implies, Monster Hunter is a
                series where the player is tasked with hunting various monsters.
                There are over 200 monsters including subspecies, variants, and deviants.
                Each monster has a distinctive feature that allows it to stand out from others.
                Some of these monsters can range from a large bear, Arzuros, to a legendary black
                dragon, Fatalis, that was said to have wiped out an entire county in one night. 
                Monsters tend to be territorial, and recent games allow them to shake things up by
                duking it out with another monster during a hunter's quest. Every monster has a 
                weakness to different elements, and certain weapons work better on different
                parts of the monsters. Researching these creatures and finding out what monster is weakest 
                to what attack is key to completing your quest.

                    <h3>One of the Monsters</h3>
                    <p>Below is Malzeno, one of the elder dragons. This monster is one of many found throughout the series. Like all monsters,
                        it won't go down without a fight.

            <h3>Locales</h3>
            <p>Knowing the location of your hunt can greatly increase the chances of success. Each location has unique features such as active volcanos,
                scorching deserts, humid swamps, freezing tundras, and lush forests. The monsters will use the enviorment to their advantage. This can from
                springing off of walls to crush the hunter, to pulling ancient weapons out of the ground to pierce their foes. In recent games, hunters have been able to
                use the enviorment aginst the monsters. Using natural traps like vines, or falling rocks, hunters can open up opportunities to unleash an all-out attack
                on the monster. Memorizing the world around you can make the difference between life and death.
