            <h3>Weapons</h3>
            <p>In order to defend themselves out in the field, hunters equip one of multiple
                different weapons. These weapons can range from the classic great sword, to the
                unusual hunting horn. Every weapons has a unique playstyle and damage type that works better against
                different monsters and various monster parts. Bladed weapons, like the dual blades and great sword, do slash damage. Blunt weapons, like the hammer and the hunting horn,
                inflict blunt damage. Ranged weapons, like the bow and light bowgun, inflict ranged damage. Weapons also come
                with an element or ailment, effects that can inflict various status effects onto a monster. With over

            <h3>Armor</h3>
            <p>Hunters can't just rely on their weapons to get the job done. After all, most of the weapons in the series have no way of defending hunters
                from a monster's visious attacks. That's where a hunter's armor set comes into play. Armor sets not only offer hunters defense against the
                monsters, but they also allow for hunters to activate different skills to give them an edge in battle. Some armor sets may give a boost to a hunter's
                stamina, and others even allow the hunters to sacrifice health for a massive damage boost. Recent games have even introduced a decoration system to give
                hunters the ability to further customize what skills they want on their equipment. Finding the proper skills for your playstyle is key for success.
