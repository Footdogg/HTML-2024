            <h2>Monsters</h2>
            <h3>General Info</h3>
            <p>As the name of the series implies, Monster Hunter is a
                series where the player is tasked with hunting various monsters.
                There are over 200 monsters including subspecies, variants, and deviants.
                Each monster has a distinctive feature that allows it to stand out from others.
                Some of these monsters can range from an large bear, Arzuros, to a legendary black
                dragon, Fatalis, that was said to have wiped out an entire county in one night. 
                Monsters tend to be territorial, and recent games allow them to shake things up by
                duking it out with another monster during a hunter's quest. Every monster has a 
                weakness to different elements, and certain weapons work better on different
                parts of the monsters. Researching these creatures and finding out what monster is weakest 
                to what attack is key to completing your quest.
            </p>

            <h2>Companions</h2>
            <h3>General Info</h3>
            <p>While hunters are strong warriors, they don't work alone. Ever since the original Moster Hunter, hunters have been
                working alongside helpful felynes. Felynes are cat helpers who assist the hunters in various ways, whether it be as a chef who prepares hefty meals, a housekeeper,
                or as a palico assisting the hunters in battle with various weapons and gadgets. Monster Hunter Rise expands on the companions wiht the introduction
                of palamutes. Palamutes are canine companions that can help fight monster like palicos, and they can let their hunter mount them to ride around the
                various locals at top speeds. Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak goes one step further, allowing fellow villagers to join the hunter out in the field. Each
                villager has their own fighting style, selection of weapons, and unique interactions with each other out in the field.
